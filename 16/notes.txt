Packet Header:
    3 bits - Packet Version
    3 bits - Type ID


Type ID 4:
    - Literal value
    - single binary number
    - Groups of bits
        - Prefix 0 for last group otherwise prefix 1
    - Group = Prefix bit + 4 bits


Type ID other:
    - Operator 
        - Some calculation on sub-packets within
    - Contains one or multiple packets
    - Length type ID:
        - After packet header
        - If 0 -> next 15 bits = total length in bits of the sub-packets
        - If 1 -> next 11 bits = number of sub-packets immediately contained
